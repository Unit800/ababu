Ababu is a free veterinary software (open source) born both as a standalone software and a network application.
So it can run on a single computer, in a local network (e.g. a veterinary clinic) or on a cloud computing (over the internet)
Initially written in PHP+MySQL and freely downloadable from www.oldauntie.org, Ababu is a C# project that aims to be a multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, any tablet or mobile), free, multi-lingual application to help veterinaries from all over the world in the cure of any kind of animal or pet using .NET (C#) framework to make it portable.
